# Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Resources:
- [Stacks_and_Queues](https://data-flair.training/blogs/stacks-and-queues-in-c/)
### Data structures:
```
/**
 * struct stack_s - doubly linked list representation of a stack (or queue)
 * @n: integer
 * @prev: points to the previous element of the stack (or queue)
 * @next: points to the next element of the stack (or queue)
 *
 * Description: doubly linked list node structure
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
 */
typedef struct stack_s
{
        int n;
        struct stack_s *prev;
        struct stack_s *next;
} stack_t;
```

```
/**
 * struct instruction_s - opcode and its function
 * @opcode: the opcode
 * @f: function to handle the opcode
 *
 * Description: opcode and its function
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
 */
typedef struct instruction_s
{
        char *opcode;
        void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
} instruction_t;

## Requirements:
> GENERAL

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the C standard library
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called ```monty.h```
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

## Compilation & Output

Code will be compiled this way:

$ ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty```
- Any output must be printed on ```stdout```
- Any error message must be printed on ```stderr```
